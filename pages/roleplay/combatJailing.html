            <h3>Combat & Jailing</h3>
            <section>
                <p>Avatarverse has unique combat mechanics, which are integral to understanding wars and personal safety
                    on the server.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h4>Combat tag</h4>
                <p>If you are attacked or you attack someone, you will be placed in a 15-second combat tag. During that
                    time you will be unable to use certain commands that might aid you to escape.</p>
                <p>Any attempt to leave the game while will combat
                    tagged automatically knocks you out when you rejoin.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h4>Knockouts</h4>
                <p>Under normal circumstances, if your health reaches zero, you are knocked out. This means you are
                    forced to lie down on the ground (if possible) and cannot move, move items in your inventory, attack
                    people, or get attacked. This
                    state lasts 60 seconds.</p>
                <p>You are also vulnerable to a number of threats:</p>
                <ul class="dashList">
                    <li>People can sneak & right-click on your body to open
                        your inventory and take any item out of it.</li>
                    <li>You can also be <a href="#shackles">handcuffed, shackled, or gagged</a>.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If you leave the game while knocked out, you will be knocked out again when you rejoin the server and
                    have to endure another 60 seconds.</p>
                <p>Being knocked out also prevents you from using certain commands:</p>
                <ul id="blockedMessage">
                    <li><span class="bold">OOC Messaging:</span> <span class="cmd">/message</span>, <span
                            class="cmd">/tell</span>, etc.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold">IC Messaging:</span> <span class="cmd">/bird</span></li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Teleport:</span> <span class="cmd">/home</span></li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Map:</span> <span class="cmd">/dynmap</span></li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Inventory:</span> <span class="cmd">/hat</span></li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h4>Duels</h4>
                <p>Duels are a way one can avoid being knocked out when the health bar reaches zero. They are designed
                    for quick, friendly spars so you don't have to wait for the knockout to end when someone loses the
                    duel.</p>
                <p>To duel someone, send a duel request with <span class="cmd">/duel &lt;character&gt;</span>. They will
                    have the opportunity of accepting it with the same command (with your character name instead of
                    theirs),
                    or denying it just by ignoring it.</p>

                <h5 class="bold" id="dttd">Duel To The Death</h5>
                <p>Duels to the Death (DttDs) are a special type of duel. When you get knocked out in a DttD, the winner
                    of the duel will have the option to land the final blow, ultimately killing your character, or wait
                    out the knockout period to spare you from death.</p>
                <p>You can duel to the death with someone by requesting and accepting with <span class="cmd">/duel
                        &lt;character&gt; death</span>.</p>

                <h4>Hunts</h4>
                <p>The main way of killing someone without their consent is by starting a hunt. Using <span
                        class="cmd">/murder &lt;character&gt;</span> or <span class="cmd">/hunt &lt;character&gt;</span>
                    will give you an item, the Murderer's Knife. You can only begin a hunt against someone who is not
                    knocked out and has at least 5 yearts of health.</p>
                <p>After acquiring the
                    knife, you will have 30 minutes to hit the person you are hunting with the knife while they are
                    knocked out, which will
                    <a href="../roleplay/characters.html#death">kill them</a>. You cannot escape a hunt by logging out,
                    the timer will only countdown when both the hunter and the person being hunted are online.
                <p>If you're successful in hunting before the time is up, you'll have to wait 3 days before you can
                    hunt again. If you're unsuccessful, you'll have to wait 5 days.</p>

                <h4 id="shackles">Restraining People</h4>
                <p>
                    Certain craftable items can be used on someone who is knocked out in order to limit their movement
                    and bending once they are awake to make them easier to control.
                </p>
                <p>There are three different types of restraining items:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="bold">Handcuffs</span> which go on people's chest slots.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Shackles</span> which go on people's feet slots</li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Gags</span> which go on people's heat slots</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Handcuffs have the following effects on people:</p>
                <ul class="dashList">
                    <li>Inability to punch other entities</li>
                    <li>Limited interactions with hands</li>
                    <li>Ability to be dragged to another location by anyone</li>

                </ul>

                <p>Shackles have the following effects on people:</p>
                <ul class="dashList">
                    <li>Slowness <span class="bold">II</span></li>
                    <li>Inability to use bending abilities that require sneaking</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Gags have the following effects on people:</p>
                <ul class="dashList">
                    <li>All messages on chat will appear as: <span class="bold">*muffled*</span>, preventing from
                        speaking.</li>
                    <li>Inability to use <span class="bold">Breath</span> abilities (ex: AirBreath, Frostbreath,
                        FlameBreath...)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Additionally all the <a href="#blockedMessage">commands blocked during knock-out</a> are also blocked
                    when handcuffed or shackled.
                </p>

                <h5 class="bold">Dragging a Handcuffed Person</h5>
                <p>To drag a handcuffed person, tap sneak while looking at them to start dragging them. They will be
                    teleported wherever you go. Do to stop dragging someone, tap sneak while looking at them again.
                    Dragging is interrupted if you take damage.</p>

                <h5 class="bold">Unlocking Handcuffs and Shackles</h5>
                <p>Shackles and Handcuffs can be <span class="bold">unlocked</span> with the use of a <span
                        class="bold">key item</span> that is generated when shackles or handcuffs are placed on someone.
                    They key will
                    only work for the specific shackle/handcuff it was generated for. Right click on a
                    shackled/handcuffed person with the
                    right key to unlock it.</p>

                <h5 class="bold">Removing a gag</h5>
                <p>You can remove someone's gag by right-clicking on them with an empty hand.</p>

                <h5>Escaping Restrain</h5>
                <p>There are ways to escape shackles, but most require a lot of work:</p>
                <ul class="dashList">
                    <li><span class="bold">Any handcuff and shackle</span> can take a little bit of damage if you
                        <span class="bold">repeatedly left-click</span>, as if you're hitting them against an object.
                        This
                        won't work for every punch and will damage you as well.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Any handcuff</span> will take damage from holding sneak with <span
                            class="bold">HeatControl</span> (burning/melting the Handcuffed)</li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Wooden handcuffs and shackles</span> will take damage if you hold sneak
                        with
                        <span class="bold">FrostBreath</span>
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Iron handcuffs and shackles</span> are escapable when holding sneak with
                        any
                        <span class="bold">metalbending</span> move
                    </li>
