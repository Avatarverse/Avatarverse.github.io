            <h3>Mobs</h3>
            <p>Avatarverse has custom mobs with unique appearances and abilities that can either be found in the wild or
                purchased. Many of these can become pets that follow you around, can be ridden across great distances,
                or fulfill some other purpose. They can be spawned and despawned at will, protecting them from being
                stolen or killed.</p>

            <section>
                <h4>Mob Menu</h4>
                <p>The mob menu is the central place to manage your mobs and can be accessed with <span
                        class="cmd">/mob</span> or <span class="cmd">/mobs</span> or through the character menu <span
                        class="cmd">/char</span>.</p>
                <p>Any mobs you purchase for your character will appear towards the bottom of the menu.</p>
                <p>When initially purchased, your mob will be placed as an egg in your mob menu with can then be hatched
                    and given a name and gender. <a href="https://store.avatarverse.net/package/6049272">Sponsors</a>
                    get 2 hatches for every mob they purchase.</p>
                <p>Selecting a hatched mob in the menu will open a submenu that allows you to spawn the mob, change its
                    name or gender, or transfer it to another character.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h4>Health & Energy</h4>
                <p>Every mob has a certain amount of health. If the health reaches zero, the mob is forcibly dismissed,
                    and you will have to spawn it again later for it to heal naturally. The speed of natural
                    regeneration is proportionate to the mob's energy level, which gradually depletes after performing
                    certain actions or just existing. If your mob's energy level reaches 0, it will also despawn, and
                    you will need to deploy it again and feed it for its energy level to recover.</p>
                <p>To feed a mob, shift and right-click on it with food in your hand. It will either dislike, like, or
                    love the food you fed it. This is important for taming wild mobs and will be important for a future
                    aspect of mobs called 'alignment' but otherwise matters little. If your mob eats the food, it will
                    gain energy from it.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h4>Commanding your mobs</h4>
                <p>All mobs can be commanded to perform certain actions through 2 ways:</p>
                <ul class="dashList">
                    <li>Speaking its name + the command in chat</li>
                    <li>Using the command <span class="cmd">/mob command &lt;mob&gt; &lt;command&gt;</span> - helpful
                        to command your mob silently.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h4>Taming</h4>
                <p>Taming a mob requires going up to it and feeding it foods it likes or loves. Feeding it loved foods
                    will maximize your chance of taming the mob. To feed, shift and right-click the mob with the food in
                    your hand repeatedly until you are prompted to name the mob. Type the name in chat and it will be
                    bonded with you. This guide will not specify which foods each mob loves; instead, that information
                    will be experimented with and documented in books in game.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h4>Mounting</h4>
                <p>Some mobs can be mounted by one or more players. The mob's owner is the only one who can drive
                    (steer) it. To mount your mob, right-click on it. If the mob has room for other passengers, a friend
                    can also right-click the mob and it will send a "ride request" to the owner. The owner can then
                    accept the request with the mob command <span class="cmd">accept</span> or <span
                        class="cmd">mount</span> (see below for specific syntax). Then the friend will mount the mob as
                    a passenger.</p>
            </section>

                <h4>Current Mobs</h4>
                <p>The Avatar world is full of entertaining creatures, many of which we plan to add, but right now we
                    are limited to the following:</p>

                <p>The Sky Bison is a large flying bison native to the Air Nation. They occasionally spawn outside of
                    the four cardinal Air Temples. They have 30 hearts of health and can be mounted, carrying up to 5
                    people at a time. They are the fastest flying mob and are great for traveling across long distances.
                    They can be tamed only by Air Nation characters who have earned the <span
                        class="italic">Bhante</span> rank or higher.</p>

                    an endangered population. There are only a handful of dragons in the world, and they are mostly
                    inherited as heirlooms in the dragonriding families <span class="italic">Dainagon</span> and <span
                        class="italic">Raa</span>, or live in the Sun Warrior city of La Bayan under the watchful eye of
                    the Sun Chief. They only take commands in Solandu, the Sun Warrior language.</p>
