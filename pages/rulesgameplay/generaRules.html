            <section>
                <h4>Avatarverse Universal Rules (AUR)</h4>
                <p><span class="bold italic">These rules are applicable in any Avatarverse-related space, including this
                        Discord server, the Minecraft servers, the forum website, and any official Avatarverse nation
                        Discord. These rules cannot be superseded by any nation's rules/laws, or else that nation's
                        leader may be subject to forced removal.</span></p>

                <ul class="numberList">
                    <li>No seriously disrespecting, harassing, or bullying players or staff, and no discriminating
                        based
                        on race, gender, sexuality, nationality, religion, etc.</li>
                    <li>No spamming chat, and no spamming commands.</li>
                    <li>No excessive caps.</li>
                    <li>No evading punishments, such as bans, tempbans, and mutes, through any method, including but
                        not
                        limited to alternate accounts and commands.</li>
                    <li>No advertising anything not related to Avatarverse in public chat. If you would like to
                        advertise something to someone, you may do that in private messages. Sending links without the
                        intention to advertise anything is permitted.</li>
                    <li>No impersonating players or staff.</li>
                    <li>No NSFW (not safe for work) chat or content.</li>
                    <li>No trying to make someone feel uncomfortable, threatened, or triggered.</li>
                    <li>No sharing anyone's personal information without their consent.</li>
                    <li>No offensive or inappropriate usernames.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Discord Server Rules (DSR)</h4>
                <p><span class="bold italic">The universal rules still apply; these rules are additional to those and
                        specific to this Discord server.</span></p>
                <ul class="numberList">
                    <li>Keep conversations appropriate to the channel purpose.</li>
                    <li>No speaking, roleplaying, or acting in any other way as a character who is deceased or whom
                        you're not currently playing. You may roleplay only as your current in-game character.</li>
                    <li>No holding a nation Discord hostage—if you are a nation leader and are deposed, you must give
                        the Discord to the new leader, or you risk being banned.</li>
                    <li>In <span class="cmd">#global-politics</span>, every message must have a greeting, a message
                        body, and a salutation. Messages must also be meaningful and important enough for that channel.
                    </li>

            </section>

            <section>
                <h4>Minecraft Server network-wide Rules (MSR)</h4>
                <p><span class="bold italic">The universal rules still apply; these rules are additional to those and
                        specific to the Minecraft servers on our network.</span></p>
                <ul class="numberList">
                    <li>No using any hacked client, and no attempting to hack the server or any of its players in any
                        way.</li>
                    <li>No griefing any server-owned building or area. Server-owned buildings tend to be public and
                        related to server-wide traffic overall.</li>
                    <li>No abusing glitches or bugs of any sort, and no using duplicators.</li>
                    <li>No intentionally causing lag. This includes but is not limited to lag-inducing redstone
                        contraptions and spamming laggy bending moves.</li>
                    <li>No using alternate Minecraft accounts unless granted permission by an admin.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h4>RPG Server Rules (RSR)</h4>
                <p><span class="bold italic">The universal and Minecraft network rules still apply; these rules are
                        additional to those and specific to the Minecraft RPG server.</span></p>
                <ul class="numberList">
                    <li>No metagaming or powergaming. Metagaming means your character uses information you have
                        learned out of roleplay but that they do not/cannot know. Powergaming means your character’s
                        roleplay imposes on others and decides their roleplay for them.</li>
                    <li>No griefing unless permitted by the Rules of War.</li>
                    <li>No building structures that aren't consistent with the server theme of Avatar: The Last
                        Airbender post-Hundred Year War. This is primarily East Asian style. If your build is hideous or
                        too far from this theme, it will be removed.</li>
                    <li>No combat logging, and no leaving the game just after being knocked out and/or cuffed.</li>
                    <li>No deleting/recreating your character for any purpose except to return to a living character.
                        This means you cannot recreate a character to change their element, reroll their subelements or
                        attempt to reverse their death. You also cannot create a character who is very similar to a
                        previous character for one of these purposes.</li>
                    <li>An adult and a minor (out-of-roleplay ages) cannot have their characters date/marry in
                        roleplay.</li>
                    <li>No ceding your entire nation (as a nation leader) to another nation during peacetime, even if
                        temporarily, unless there are no capable successor candidates in your own nation.</li>
                    <li>No using a surname that has been claimed in #family-records unless you are part of that
                        family or have permission from them.</li>
                    <li>No claiming an action you took in game was out of roleplay (such as to avoid in-roleplay
                        consequences), unless all participating parties of that action agree otherwise. Any action taken
                        by your character in game is considered roleplay until agreed otherwise by all participants
                        (e.g. breaking a nation's law, shacking/robbing/attacking someone, etc.).</li>
                </ul>
