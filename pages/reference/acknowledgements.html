            <h3>Server History & Acknowledgements</h3>

            <section>
                <h4>The Bending Age world</h4>
                <p>Not all of the credit for Avatarverse's world and builds can be given to our build team. The world
                    itself was painted years ago for the now-defunct Avatar server Bending Age and was gifted to us with
                    the assent of Bending Age's former staff in 2020. Many of the major sites on the server are
                    alterations of builds from Bending Age, most notably:</p>
                <ul class="circleList">
                    <li>Exterior of the Fire Nation Royal Palace</li>
                    <li>Some of Caldera City's houses</li>
                    <li>Many Fire Nation villages</li>
                    <li>The southernmost portion of Ninuno (Sun Warriors island)</li>
                    <li>Exterior of the Ba Sing Se Royal Palace</li>
                    <li>Portions of Ba Sing Se's Upper Ring</li>
                    <li>Portions of Agna Qel'a</li>
                    <li>Layout and central buildings of the Northern Air Temple and Eastern Air Temple</li>
                    <li>Miscellaneous structures throughout the world that would take too long to catalogue</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Few if any of our players played on Bending Age, but their community still exists on the Internet.
                    When the world was given to us, it came with the superflat world the BA staff used for building, as
                    well as all of the items people had in chests. These rare items are sometimes jokingly and
                    affectionately referred to as "ancient artifacts" in current Avatarverse roleplay, though few know
                    their true origins.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h4>Developing Avatarverse</h4>
                <p>Since August of 2020, Avatarverse put together a small team of builders to fix up the map. They
                    labored tirelessly until March 2021 (the release of Avatarverse RPG) to build a world ready for
                    players.</p>
                <p> Here are those former staff members' acknowledgements:</p>
                <ul class="circleList">
                    <li>Administrator Kameron built Omashu, Anana Tun'ila, the Agna Qel'a Royal Palace, Port Silana on
                        Whaletail Island, Kyoshi Island, most of Ba Sing Se's Middle Ring, Caldera City, and other
                        builds...</li>
                    <li>Staff member Aqualon has the distinction of giving access to the Bending Age world to
                        Avatarverse's owner, Aztl</li>
                    <li>Staff member Infin re-painted portions of the world, updating them from their original 1.12
                        landscapes to the modern era</li>
                    <li>Staff member Parker was Avatarverse's first designer and created textures and models for
                        dragons, bison, and many other mobs, alongside Kameron, and also helped build various structures
                    </li>
                    <li>Staff members/builders cuchibarbie, NickC1211, xris, Xhosu, and Tree built much of Anana Tun'ila
                        alongside Kameron</li>
                    <li>Builder Stacker contributed to the construction of Omashu</li>
                    <li>Owner Aztl terraformed and built much of Ba Sing Se's Lower Ring</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Building was not the only thing going on before Avatarverse's beta release. The earliest RPG systems
                    were being coded by the server owner, Aztl, and were compiled into a few plugins:</p>
                <ul class="circleList">
                    <li><span class="bold">Azimuth</span> - the precursor to Avatarverse's character and nations
                        systems,
                        which had a character creation menu very similar our current one</li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Fauna</span> - a plugin for handling custom dragon/bison behavior</li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Nonbenders</span> - a bending plugin that introduced nonbending subclasses to
                        the game</li>
                    <li><span class="bold">ProjectKorra</span> - a plugin created by the ProjectKorra development team
                        and greatly altered by Aztl to make a bending leveling & progression system</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h4>Release</h4>
                <h5 class="bold">Plugin Development</h5>
                <h5>2021</h5>
                <ul class="dashList">
                    <li>Avatarverse RPG was released on March 6, 2021 under the former name "Indigon". There were lots
                        of new players eager to try out the new server and lots of bugs to squash.</li>

                    <li>In May of that year, Aztl began working on a new RPG core plugin to add tons of new features to
                        the game. In June, the server rebranded from its former name to "Avatarverse".</li>

                    <li>In July, Aztl released <span class="italic">Routes</span>, a new plugin that connected the world via
                        a global oceanic transportation system.</li>

                    <li>In August, Avatarverse became cross-platform.</li>

                    <li>In October, the <span class="italic">Azmiuth</span> plugin received an update that added the
                        <span class="cmd">/character</span> command and some combat features.
                    </li>

                    <li>In November, subelements became randomized upon character creation.</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>2022</h5>

                <ul class="dashList">
                    <li>In January of 2022, <span class="italic">Avatarverse Core</span> was released, which included
                        a brand new nations system that worked seamlessly with the character and other systems already
                        put in place under the old Azimuth plugin and marked the beginning of a new era of consolidating
                        all custom features into one plugin that facilitated their interlinkage.</li>

                    <li>In May, <span class="italic">Avatarverse Core</span> got its first update, the <a
                            href="../roleplay/combatJailing.html" class="italic">Combat & Jailing Update</a>. It allowed
                        characters to hunt and murder each other, as well as handcuff one and another and bring people
                        into custody. It also got rid of the unpopular leveling system introduced in Beta's early days.
                    </li>

                    <li>In August, another update was released, which added the <span class="cmd">/reroll</span>
                        command, added a grace period for new characters, and updated the server to 1.19.</li>

                    <li>On New Year's Eve 2022, the December update was released, adding 5 more hearts to players'
                        health and other numerous quality-of-life changes.</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>2023</h5>

                <ul class="dashList">
                    <li>In February of 2023, Aztl introduced some quality-of-life changes for nonbenders,
                        like the command /hotbarfollow or /hbf.
                    </li>

                    <li>In June, Aztl released a major update that allowed people to create and switch
                        between multiple characters seamlessly.
                    </li>

                    <li>In October, admin shops using NPCs were released.</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>2024</h5>

                <ul class="dashList">
                    <li>In February of 2024, the build team completely reworked the Southern Air Temple, as well as
                        a new spawn island, Supāno, while Aztl created a new player walkthrough.
                    </li>

                    <li>In March, Aztl created a new pets system that let characters tame, own, ride,
                        and command a variety of animals.
                    </li>

                    <li>In May, Aztl released a sandbending update, adding 9 new sandbending moves and tweaking a few others.</li>

                    <li>In June, Aztl released the Lotus Shop, where people can buy protected furniture and other cosmetics.
                        Later that month, he added combat protection within settlements to help protect roleplay from being
                        excessively derailed by PvPers. Overrides were then added to allow for combat in these areas,
                        such as by nation police and approved antagonists. Meanwhile, Bah the builder released a reworked
                        Ember Island.
                    </li>

                    <li>In July, Aztl released a new "property" system which allowed people to buy/rent protected plots
                        of land, the payment of which went to nation treasuries. The currency was also re-digitized,
                        and all former physical currency was rendered defunct. A new mail system was also introduced,
                        allowing people to send items to each other.
                    </li>

                    <li>In October, the Western Air Temple and Crescent Island were completely redone by the build team.
                        Later that month, Aztl released a game-changing update that introduced a new XP system with
                        levels and skill trees that characters could progress through. This update also introduced
                        hundreds of new items and recipes, as well as a new cooking system.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h5 class="bold">Construction</h5>
                <p>Many construction projects have taken place since Beta launched, so many that it is hard to keep
                    track. Most of them were carried out under the auspices of nation leaders who wanted to improve the
                    aesthetics of the land they ruled. Therefore, a new staff role, <span class="italic">Contract
                        Builder</span>, was created, whosepurpose was to build for a specific nation until that project
                    was completed. Building new towns and reworking existing ones also became a way for nation leaders
                    to prove their aptitude. Here are some highlights:</p>

                <ul class="circleList">
                    <li>First reconstruction of Republic City by the build team in general</li>
