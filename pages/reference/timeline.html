                        Bianqui, Apoy, and Chieseret south of the Western Air Temple from the Sun Empire. The Water
                        Tribe acquired the islands after Water Chieftess Rin coerced the Air Nation into giving her the
                        islands, which was later brought to public knowledge. Some of them were traded around, first to
                        the Sun Empire, then to the Foggy Swamp Tribe. The Sun Empire acquired the islands south of the
                        Western Air Temple during the reign of Azutoru under the condition that the Sun Warriors do not
                        enter an unnecessary war, a condition which the Air Nation believes to have been broken. After

                        dead. Izocoa demands that Alinova steps down and becomes Magister (governor) of Hortezuca, or
                        there will be bloodshed. Alinova, beyond tired of public threats against her and her family,
                        takes the offer and names her brother the Sun Emperor. Shortly after becoming Emperor, Izocoa
                        gifts the Chameleon Islands and Azu, an island named after his father, back to the Earth
                        Kingdom, the result of a deal between Destra and Izocoa.</li>

                        Sun Chief N'Jadaka calls for a trial of the Water Tribe's Luminary Aruni Taoluk for assaulting
                        him and another Sun Warrior in their own land. Moments later, Luminary Hiroko Taoluk, claims
                        that he witnessed the murder of Water Chief Zia at the hands of his sister Aruni. He then
                        proclaims to be the new Water Chief and banishes Aruni. N'Jadaka calls into question the
                        veracity of this claim, believing Hiroko to have framed Aruni for his murder of Zia. N'Jadaka
                        then pronounces Aruni dead, most likely having killed her himself.

                        themselves to the Fire Nation and Sun Warriors to face a trial answering for their separate

                        for 20 years for the Fire Nation, Sun Warriors, and Earth Kingdom. Izel claims the demands are
                        due to the Air Nation continually breaking promises and allowing criminal nomads into positions
                        of power. Avatar Tharra tries to defuse the situation, the Earth Kingdom closes their borders to
                        Air Nomads, and Eastern Elder Shu resigns and joins the Fire Nation. Shortly afterwards, when
                        Western Elder Puh does not surrender herself, Fire Lord Izel increases the demands to include
                        the cession of seven islands in the Southern Archipelago. After negotiations, Western Elder Puh
                        decides to surrender and stand trial, the Air Nation accepts all demands but is able to haggle
                        down to ceding only the islands of Kharabuja, Prahari, and Lhakhang, and Puh steps down as
                        elder. The Sun Warriors then also close their borders to Air Nomads.
