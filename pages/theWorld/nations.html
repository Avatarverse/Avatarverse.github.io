                    and pursuit of power have often put it at odds with the other nations. Despite its militaristic
                    image, the Fire Nation also has a rich cultural heritage, including art, music, and philosophy.</p>

                <h4>Player-Run Nations</h4>
                <p>One of the primary features of Avatarverse is the presence of player-run nation states governing
                    almost all characters. Nations are the backdrop of all roleplay on the server and the building
                    blocks of player-driven politics.</p>
                <p>Players are given the freedom to steer national and international politics on their own accord.
                    Therefore, nation leaders can make and unmake laws, punish their citizens justly or unjustly,
                    declare wars, etc. A nation is not guaranteed to always exist. That said, in extraordinary
                    circumstances, the <a href="../rulesgameplay/rpc.html">Roleplay Council</a> reserves the right to
                    intervene in situations that are believed to cause excessive or irreversible damage to the roleplay
                    integrity of the server.</p>

                <p>Nations organize on their own <a target="_blank"
                        href="https://disboard.org/server/join/607348576045105162">Discord Servers</a> owned by the
                    nation's leader and passed from one leader to another. These servers vary significantly because the
                    Nation Leaders have full creative freedom but must abide by <a
                        href="../rulesgameplay/generaRules.html">Avatarverse Rules</a> in these spaces nonetheless.</p>
            </section>

            <h3>The Nation System</h3>
            <p>Avatarverse has a unique system for handling its nation states, somewhat similar to plugins like
                Factions, Towny, or Kingdoms. Nations are complex objects containing provinces, settlements, resource
                nodes, citizens, and ranks.</p>

            <section>
                <h4>Geofeatures</h4>
                <p>A geofeature is something with a geographical domain, an object or area that takes up space, The
                    nation system has several types of geofeatures, the most fundamental being the <span
                        class="italic">chunk</span>.</p>
                <ul class="circleList">
                    <li>Nations</li>
                    <li>Provinces</li>
                    <li>Settlements</li>
                    <li>Nodes</li>
                    <li>Chunks</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h4>Chunks</h4>
                <p>To understand nations, we must first understand chunks. A chunk is a rectangular prism of a width of
                    16 blocks and a height spanning from Minecraft's minimum to maximum height.</p>
                <p>The chunk is the building block of the nation system's geofeatures.</p>
                <p>For more information about chunks, check out <a
                        href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Chunk">Minecraft's Wiki </a>.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h4>Settlements</h4>
                <p>A settlement is a <span class="italic">protected</span> group of chunks within a province. It is a
                    subset of a province and is owned by whichever nation owns the province. Only members of a
                    settlement's parent nation can build/destroy in the settlement, unless they are placed on that
                    settlement's whitelist.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h4>Nodes</h4>
                <p>A node is a <span class="italic">protected</span> group of chunks within a province that can overlap
                    with settlements and has special properties that differentiate it from settlements. Nodes also have
                    whitelists, although the members of the whitelists aren't individuals but whole nations who are
                    permitted to use the node.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h4>Provinces</h4>
                <p>A province is a group of chunks. Provinces have names and are always owned by a nation. They also
                    have a color, which is a randomized derivation of their parent nation's color.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h4>Nations</h4>
                <p>A nation, at its fundamental level, is a group of provinces. Nations also have a variety of settings
                    that set them apart from other nations, such as a unique name, color, and banner. They also have a
                    set of ranks, at the top of which is the nation leader, and a settlement they count as their
                    capital. Nations have a population of citizens as well.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h4>Resource Nodes</h4>
                <p>The world of Avatarverse has conventions that differ from those of other Minecraft servers. It is
                    not full of ores and other resources. Because of that, it is instead filled with regenerating nodes
                    dedicated to specific resources, often just referred to as <span class="bold">nodes</span>.</p>

                <p>A node is usually a small area that contains copious amounts of a specific resource or set of
                    resources, as well as a clickable sign that allows anyone to regenerate the node every hour <span
                        class="italic">(some nodes have a longer cooldown)</span>.</p>

                <p>These nodes are owned by the nation that claimed territory where the node is located and forbids
                    resource extraction by foreigners. The only way to gain resources located in nodes from other
                    nations is to trade with the people of that nation. Because of that, resource nodes have largely
                    become political tools for nation leaders in trade deals and other ways.</p>

                <h4>Nation Ranks</h4>
                <p>Each nation has a rank system that is completely customizable according to the nation leader's needs.
                    Each rank has a numerical priority from 1 to 100, with 1 denoting the lowest priority, a regular
                    citizen, and 100 denoting the highest priority, the nation leader.</p>

                <p>Ranks are displayed in front of a character's name in all chat channels and contain a set of nation
                    permissions. The rank can either possess or lack access to a certain nation permission, allowing or
                    prohibiting a certain nation action or command.</p>
